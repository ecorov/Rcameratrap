Description: Correlated random walk of the target animal is simulated within the range of camera trap grid, 
    using the distributions of step length, turning angles, and size of home range from footprint chain data. 
    The simulated movement of the default 1-10 individuals generates pseudo camera trap data, which are matched 
    with the real data using the random forest algorithm, in order to find the best fit of animal abundance 
    among the abundance from 1 to 10.
